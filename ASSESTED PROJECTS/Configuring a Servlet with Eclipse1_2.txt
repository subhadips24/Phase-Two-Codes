Checking for servlet-api.jar

1 Before building the project, we need to add servlet-api.jar to the project

4 In the Project Explorer, right click on FirstServlet and choose Properties
5 Select Java Build Path from the options on the left
6 Click on Libraries tab on the right
7 Under ClassPath, expand the node that says Apache Tomcat
8 If there is an existing entry for servlet-api.jar, then click on Cancel and exit the window

10 From the file list, select servlet-api.jar file and click Ok
11  Click on Apply and Close
